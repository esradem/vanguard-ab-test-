    "# Experiment Evaluation\n",
    "## 1. Design Effectiveness\n",
    "### Structure:\n",
    "The experiment appears to be well-structured. There are clearly defined Test and Control groups, and a consistent measurement framework (i.e., funnel steps and success outcomes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Assignment:\n",
    "If the assignment to Test vs Control was random (e.g., through backend logic or user-session routing), then the experiment likely minimized selection bias.\n",
    " Suggestion: Check if the proportion of clients in each group is roughly equal. A strong imbalance could indicate implementation bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Biases:\n",
    "Some potential biases to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If certain client types (e.g., older clients or low-engagement users) were more likely to be assigned to one group.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If clients could self-select into groups by device, entry point, or time of day.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Duration Assessment\n",
    "- Period:\n",
    "The experiment ran from March 15, 2017 to June 20, 2017, giving it a duration of just over 3 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adequacy:\n",
    "This duration is generally sufficient for collecting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple user sessions across different clients\n",
    "\n",
    "Weekday/weekend behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonal variation is likely minimal in this timeframe\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3-month window provides statistically meaningful insights if sample sizes are healthy across both groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Additional Data Needs\n",
    "To enhance the analysis, the following data would be valuable:\n",
    "\n",
    "Client segmentation: Demographics, risk profile, investment goals, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic source or entry channel: Email, direct, mobile app, etc. (to detect source-driven behavior)\n",
    "\n",
    "Device/browser info: To assess performance or behavior differences across platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative feedback: Any user satisfaction or friction points tied to the new design\n",
    "\n",
    "Timestamp granularity: For deeper behavioral time tracking (e.g., session duration, pause between steps)"
