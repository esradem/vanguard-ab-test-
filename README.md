# Vanguard A/B Test Analysis

##  Overview
This project analyzes the results of a digital A/B test conducted by Vanguard, a US-based investment management company. The experiment aimed to evaluate whether a redesigned user interface (UI) improved the process completion rate among clients.

## Objective
Determine whether the new UI led to:
- Higher completion rates
- Statistically significant improvements
- Justifiable changes based on cost-effectiveness (≥ 5% improvement)

## Data Sources
- `df_final_experiment_clients.txt`: Experiment group assignment (Test vs Control)
- `df_final_demo.txt`: Client demographic and account data
- `df_final_web_data_pt_1.txt` and `df_final_web_data_pt_2.txt`: Clickstream data detailing process steps

##  Data Preparation
- Merged the three datasets on `client_id`
- Identified process completion by detecting the final `process_step` per client
- Filtered for valid gender values (M, F) and removed duplicates
- Created derived columns: `completed`, `Variation`, and demographic summaries

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed client age, gender, tenure, and interaction behavior
- Explored process completion patterns across groups
- Identified drop-off points in the digital funnel

##  Hypothesis Testing
1. **Test vs Control Completion Rates** (Z-test): Test group had significantly higher completion rate.
2. **Cost-Effectiveness Threshold**: Improvement exceeded 5%, justifying redesign costs.
3. **Age Differences** (T-test): No significant age difference between groups.
4. **Gender Completion Differences** (Chi-Square Test): No significant relationship between gender and completion.
5. **Group-specific Gender Differences**: Analyzed using Chi-Square tests within each group.

##  Visualizations
- Completion rate bar charts by group, age, and gender
- Funnel step drop-off visualization
- Tableau dashboards for interactive filtering and demographic insights

##  Conclusion
The data supports rolling out the new UI due to a statistically and practically significant improvement in completion rates. No demographic biases were detected, and further improvements are recommended using post-rollout behavioral feedback.
